<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>Hello, there.</p>
<p>I'm Shuyang Li from Shenzhen, China. I'm currently studying Computer Science and English at University of Notre Dame.</p>
<p>I'm strongly interested in technology, data science, design, communications, entrepreneurship, gamification, and urban planning. I'm concerned with how technology, design, games, and playfulness could enhance individual lives and community interactions. Specifically, I ponder on embedding technology in everyday products (the Internet of Things), interacting with technology in novel ways (wearable technology), and utilizing human emotion and psychology as a force for good (gamification).</p>
<p>I am doing my summer internship at <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a> this year (summer 2014)! I'm planning to write what I see and what I think on <a href="https://medium.com/@shuyangl">Medium</a>, so stay tuned!</p>

<h1>SCHOOLWORK</h1>
<p>Currently, my courses related to Computer Science are <a href="http://www3.nd.edu/~cse/2014sp/20212/">Fundamentals of Computing II</a>, <a href="http://wizard.cse.nd.edu/courses/cse20189/www/">Basic UNIX for Engineers</a>, and Digital Logic Design. Fundamentals of Computing covers basic Computer Science concepts, and helps us to understand imperative and object-oriented programming; Basic UNIX for Engineers covers common utilities for UNIX and scripting using csh, bash, Perl, and Python; Digital Logic Design focuses on lower-level logical structures, and we're required to design combinational and sequential logic circuits and to realize them in Verilog HDL.</p>
<p>Outside of school, I am a motivated learner for life, a heavy reader, and a music and movie addict. I'm also big on MOOCs: I have finished <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/proglang">Programming Languages</a>, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/hciucsd">Human-Computer Interaction</a>, and <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/compstrategy">Competitive Strategy</a> on Coursera, and am learning <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/gamification">Gamification</a> and <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/ml">Machine Learning</a>. I am also learning French using <a href="https://www.duolingo.com">Duolingo</a>.</p>

<h1>ACTIVITIES</h1>
<p>I just started researching for the <a href="http://www.icensa.com">Interdisciplinary Center for Network Sciences and Applications</a> at Notre Dame, under the advisory of <a href="http://www3.nd.edu/~nchawla/">Dr. Nitesh Chawla</a>. Currently I'm developing an Android app for a healthcare analytics project concerning diabetes diagnosis and intervention.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://studentgovernment.nd.edu">Notre Dame Student Government</a>, I am Director of Campus Technology. My current responsibilities include discussing university strategy on IT with VP and CIO Ron Kraemer, representing undergraduate student body on the <a href="http://committees.nd.edu/committees-a-z/university-council-for-academic-technologies-ucat/">University Council for Academic Technology</a>, and leading a team of 15 to work with the Office of Information Technologies to address undergraduate student needs in technology.	Last year, as a member of the Department of Academic Affairs, I co-directed the creation of Financial Market supplementary major in the College of Science, oversaw TEDxUND, worked on several aspects of the mobileND app, and addressed academic technology and online learning at Notre Dame.</p>
<p>I am working with <a href="http://mynotredame.nd.edu">Notre Dame Alumni Associations</a> as their Web/IT Support Specialist. My responsibilities include building website and providing support for various alumni clubs, constructing marketing email, running Google Analytics, and so on. I have built websites for several ND clubs, and have sent emails to over 80,000 alumni. I'm also participating in their website redesign.</p>
<p>Also, I am Art Director and Producer of <a href="http://www.ndshowsomeskin.com">Show Some Skin</a>, an annual theatrical production at University of Notre Dame. Show Some Skin provides a platform for everyone in the Notre Dame community to voice out their inspiring or distressing experiences with personal identity, which I found very meaningful especially at Notre Dame. I also participate in campaigns with <a href="http://prism.nd.edu">PrismND</a> to raise awareness of the LGBTQ community in the university.</p>
