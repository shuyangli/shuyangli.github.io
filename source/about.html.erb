    <h2>Shuyang <span id="self_description"></span>.</h2>

    <p>My home is Shenzhen, China, and I'm currently finishing my last year of college in Notre Dame, IN. I've bookmarked hundreds of places in San Francisco in preparation of moving there in 2016.</p>

    <p>I design and build software for a living, and I really like what I do.</p>

    <p>Starting with OS X Yosemite, your Mac has my voice in Chinese. You can laugh at my awkwardness by running these commands in Terminal:
      <pre>afplay "/System/Library/CoreServices/Language Chooser.app/Contents/Resources/VOInstructions-zh-Hans.m4a"</pre>
      <pre>afplay "/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ScreenReader.framework/Versions/A/Resources/VoiceOver Quickstart.app/Contents/Resources/VOTraining.bundle/Contents/Resources/intro-zh_CN.m4a"</pre>
