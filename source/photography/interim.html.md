title: Interim Portraits
---

I made these images to emulate [Bill Jacobson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Jacobson) in my photography class in college. Jacobson collected many anonymous snapshots from flea markets, and reflecting on those snapshots, he said: "[t]hey would immediately bring to mind that the subjects were no longer alive, or were decades older than when the images were made. The figures in them were often blurred or obscured, and this became a parallel for the passage of time, illness, or death." I'm interested in how we experience these feelingsâ€”passage of time, illness, and death.

A presentation of Bill Jacobson's work I made can be found here. [(.key with comments)](/assets/emulation.key) [(.pdf without comments)](/assets/emulation.pdf)
