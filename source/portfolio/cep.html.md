Cross-Strait Exploration Project (CEP) is an annual, week-long forum that brings together students and scholars from Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan for cultural and civil dialogue.

In 2012, with the introduction of a new field research program, I redesigned the brand identity for CEP, and showcased our focus on understanding modern Chinese culture by mixing bold Chinese calligraphy with modern typefaces.

Working with another designer, I also created badges and certificates for participants. The large text on the badges brought out the beauty of Chinese characters, as well as encouraged conversations—it’s hard to forget names this way!
